## "The Excitement of Nobody" by Bihan Dasgupta

### What this is
I made a phone you can’t quite trust. While it’s “locked,” it buzzes with life—Instagram mentions, TikTok comments, Discord pings, Snaps, DMs, even LinkedIn nudges—arriving at irregular intervals. The suspense builds: who noticed me, what did I miss? Then you click to unlock, and everything disappears. “You have no new notifications...”

This piece lives in that in‑between feeling I often have when I step away from my phone: the excitement of being wanted and the fear of being forgotten. Anticipation, then absence.

### See it
- Live: https://the-excitement-of-nobody.netlify.app

### How to experience
- Click the lock screen to “Face ID” and unlock.
- While locked, wait; notifications roll in at a human rhythm (~2–3/min). A soft beep (turn on sound in the corner) keeps time with your anticipation.
- Scroll the middle area to see the thread of what “happened.” Time/date and the instruction stay pinned, like a real phone.
- Unlocking wipes it clean. Lock again to restart the loop.

### A note on the build (brief)
- Built with React and hand‑rolled CSS. The sound is a tiny Web Audio tone (no samples, no data collection). The “Face ID” is visual only—no camera, no biometrics.
